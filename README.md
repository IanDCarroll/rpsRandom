rpsRandom is a ramonizer/selector for anything that requires shuffling 
or random selection.

Each element battles for victory in a Rock-Paper-Scissors throwdown
to see which gets prescidence, and what order the runners up fall into.

Sure, you could easily make a call to random for this kind of functionality.
Sure, it would be less resource intensive and quicker to do so.
But does that optimized solution make the elements rock-paper-scissors 
for the outcome?

rpsRandom is for the ironic cool kid 
who want's to randomly select/order the awesome way.
