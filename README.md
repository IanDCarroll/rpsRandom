rps is a ramonizer/selector for anything that requires shuffling 
or random selection.

RPS has each element of a list/array-like object, map/dictionary, 
or series of args battle compete in a Rock-Paper-Scissors throwdown
to see which gets prescidence, and what order the runners up fall into.

Sure, you could easily make a call to random for this kind of functionality.
Sure, it would be less resource intensive and quicker to do so.
But does that optimized method make the elements rock-paper-scissors 
for the outcome?

This short script is for the ironic hipster who want's to randomly 
select/order the awesome way. 
Consequences be damned!
